# Hang Up!

This is the third iteration on my personal portfolio. It features past, current and maybe future projects that I am working on!

Here is a list of some of the technologies it uses:
* Classic HTML / CSS
* Vanilla Javascript with a touch of jQuery for DOM interaction
* [React]
* Babel (browser.js) to transform JSX bits into regular ES5 js.
* [Semantic-UI] to harmonize the main layout
* [Transit] to harness powerful smooth animation
* Gulp as a task runner.

### TODOS
* *SMCSS approach to organize app.css (it starts to get messy...)*
* *Create a dedicated page for each project*


#### Milestones
* 2nd iteration: Sep 29, 2014
* 3rd iteration: Oct 5, 2015
