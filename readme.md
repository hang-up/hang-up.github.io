# Hang Up!

This is the third iteration on my personal portfolio. It features past, current and maybe future projects that I am working on!

It is built using (non exhaustive list):
* Classic HTML / CSS
* Vanilla Javascript with a touch of jQuery for DOM interaction
* [React] for displaying workshop items.
* [Semantic-UI] to harmonize the main layout
* [Transit] to harness powerful smooth animation
* Gulp as a task runner.

### TODOS
* *SMCSS approach to organize app.css (it starts to get messy...)*
* *Rework on workshop item fading feature - get rid of dimmer.js which is conflicting with transit.js*
* *Create a dedicated page for each project*
